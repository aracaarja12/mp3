Q1: This is a duplicated code code smell. I refactored it by extracting the duplicated code from 
	both occurrences and making a new function out of it that both duplicate occurrences now 
	call (extract method). 

Q2: Completed. 

Q3: updateAndTrim is a feature envy code smell because both lines rely on methods from another 
	class. To refactor this, I moved updateAndTrim from the Nodes class to the jenkins class. 

Q4: I used a while loop with four iterations to eliminate the repeated code. Each iteration runs 
	the code that was repeated, but instead of a breaking from the inner while loop, I broke 
	on a label that encapsulated the outer for loop. Everything else remained the same. 
	The test class to test this change is jenkins.model.q4Test. It's located in mp3/test/src/test/
	java/jenkins/model. 

Q5: Completed. 

Q6: I decided to refactor the duplicated code in the testDoScript() and testDoEval() functions of
	jenkins.model.JenkinsTest. I did this with extract method refactoring. The new method, 
	getWebClient(), returns an initialized web client to the tests calling it.
